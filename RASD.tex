\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
Students\&Companies (S\&C) is a dynamic platform designed to connect university students seeking internships with companies offering valuable opportunities. By leveraging students' skills, experiences, and career interests alongside the specific needs and offerings of companies, S\&C aims to create seamless matches. The platform provides a recommendation system that notifies students about relevant internships and informs companies of suitable candidates. It also facilitates the selection process, supports feedback exchange, and helps both parties refine their profiles for better alignment. S\&C results useful thanks to the offered tools for monitoring internship progress and resolving issues collaboratively.
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{G1} The companies can post on the platform the internships they want to advertise.
  \item \textbf{Requirement} Students can share their CVs on the platform
  \item \textbf{G2} The students can proactively look for internships posted by the companies on the platform.
  \item \textbf{G3} The students are suggested internships by the platform based on their CVs.
  \item \textbf{G5} The companies get information on some students that could interest them based on their CVs.
  \item \textbf{G1} Matches registered companies and students based on the information provided by internship advertisements and students' resumes.
  \item \textbf{G2} Allows registered students to proactively querying S\&C to identify interesting companies.
   \item \textbf{G3} Allows to start the assessment process for internship candidates after mutual approval, manages interview scheduling for companies, and finalizes candidate selections.
   \item \textbf{G4} Allows all sides to monitor the internship process and collects data from feedbacks and suggestions.
    \item \textbf{G5} Provides a recommendation to show an interesting profile to both sides.
    \item \textbf{G6} Provides suggestions to registered students and companies for enhancing internship advertisements and resumes using collected feedback data.
    \item \textbf{G7} Enables registered universities to monitor the internship process, handle complaints, and interrupt the internship when necessary.

        \item \textbf{S11} The system notifies a company about an interesting student resume.
        \item \textbf{S12} The system notifies to a student an internship that might interest him is available.
        \item \textbf{S13} The system starts a contact process when both an internship and a student confirm an interest in each other.
        \item \textbf{S14} The system shows some information about a student profiles to a company.
        \item \textbf{S15} The system shows some information about an internship advertisement and a company profile to a student.
        \item \textbf{S16} The system notifies a student when the interview date is scheduled.
        \item \textbf{S17} The system creates an interview link and send to both sides.
        \item \textbf{S19} The system analyzes the feedback data and provides suggestions for improving the profiles. 
        \item \textbf{S20} The system recommends interesting profiles to the both sides.
        \item \textbf{S21} The system notifies a student when the company's decision is announced.
