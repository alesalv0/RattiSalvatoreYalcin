\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
Students\&Companies (S\&C) is a dynamic platform designed to connect university students seeking internships with companies offering valuable opportunities. By leveraging students' skills, experiences, and career interests alongside the specific needs and offerings of companies, S\&C aims to create seamless matches. The platform provides a recommendation system that notifies students about relevant internships and informs companies of suitable candidates. It also facilitates the selection process, supports feedback exchange, and helps both parties refine their profiles for better alignment. S\&C results useful thanks to the offered tools for monitoring internship progress and resolving issues collaboratively.
\subsubsection{Goals}
The goals specify what the platform will allow users to achieve in the real world, everything else will not be allowed. 
\\All the starred words will be defined in section 1.3 to avoid any ambiguity.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{G1} Allows registered companies* to post* and advertise* the available internships that they offer.
  \item \textbf{G2} Allows registered students* to proactively and autonomously search and apply* to advertised internships.
  \item \textbf{G3} Helps registered students and registered companies by suggesting them appealing templates for their CVs and internship projects drafts.
  \item \textbf{G4} Allows a registered student to be recommended a list of advertised internships that might be of interest to him/her with respect to: his/her uploaded CV, the internships projects* and users'* feedbacks.
  \item \textbf{G5} Allows a registered company to be recommended a list of registered students who might be of interest for one of its advertised internships with respect to: their uploaded CVs, the internship project and users' feedbacks.
  \item \textbf{G6} Allows a registered company to view the list of all the students who applied to one of its advertised internships grouped by the internship they applied to.
  \item \textbf{G7} Allows a company to get in contact* with the candidates* for one of its internships and, only after, manage their selection process*.
  \item \textbf{G8} Allows registered companies and students that are taking part* in an ongoing internship to comment about it.
  \item \textbf{G9} Allows a registered university to view the comments about an ongoing internship, written either by its interning students or by the host company.
  \item \textbf{G10} Allows a registered university to interrupt an ongoing internship involving one its students.
      \item \textbf{G11} Allows companies and students to provide feedback about a past internships only if they respectively offered it and took part in it.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}

\subsubsection{Definitions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recommendation: It's a platform feature that starts a matching between a company and a student. If both parties accept the recommendation, the student is taken for the selection process
        \item Accepting: The act of students or companies, who got recommended to each other, to confirm their interest. 
        \item Selection: It's the process that starts after the expiration date of applying for the internship. The company interviews every accepted student and picks the best one(s) for their needs. 
        \item Feedback: Refers to the comments and questionary that both parties are asked to fill in at the end of the internship contract, in order to improve the platform.
        \item Observation: Is anything written in the dedicated Observations section. Serves the student or the company currently engaged, to highlight something about the experience with each other. If that's a complaint from either, the University of the student will manage the situation.
        \item Complaint: It's a specific type of Observation, where the University of the student is called to act and manage the situation between the parties.
        \item Contact: The mutual acceptance of recommendation between student and company on the same internship.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1st Scenario: Signing up. User John has accessed the opening page; he registers into the site as a student, filling the required data and is sent back to the opening page.
        \item 2nd Scenario: Logging in. User John is in the opening page; he logs into the site using his credentials, and can now access to his possible operations.
        \item 3rd Scenario: Finalizing registration. The student John opens his profile page and uploads his CV document into the platform; he studies at Polime, so he connects his university mail with his account.
        \item 4th Scenario: Starting an offer. The company Emazon posts an internship offer on the platform, deciding the expiration date and the duration of it. Then Emazon lists the tasks the student will have to perform, the application domain and other relevant things regarding the internship.  
        \item 5th Scenario: Platform recommendation. Upon CV uploading, the   platform analyzes John's CV and automatically suggests him all the current potential interesting internship offers. After Emazon has posted its internship offer, it gets notified to him too.
        \item 6th Scenario: Searching Internships. John opens the page of the available internships. He filters out the ones without benefits, and is left with few options. He applies for Guggl's offer.
        \item 7th Scenario: Student accepts recommendation. John gets the
        notification from Emazon and decides to accept it.
        \item 8th Scenario: Company accepts students. After Emazon posted the internship offer, it gets recommended some students by the platform, while some other students found the internship by manual searching. Emazon accepts John and some other students.
        \item 9th Scenario: Entering the selection. After the expiration date passes, the company starts the selection process. Emazon proposes the interviews dates and time schedules through the dedicated interface to all the contacted students.
        \item 10th Scenario: Student chooses interview day. Since John has established contact with Emazon, he selects the time and day of the interview through the dedicated interface.
        \item 11th Scenario: Student joins the interview. When the scheduled day for the interview comes, John can meet the interviewer using the link posted by the company on the platform. After some time, the platform officially notifies him that he was selected.
        \item 12th Scenario: Writing Observations. Emazon writes a complaint in the provided space about John's current behaviour.
        \item 13th Scenario: University acts. The University Polime gets a complaint from Emazon about John's behaviour. Polime decides to interrupt his internship.
        \item 14th Scenario: Giving Feedback. At the end of the internship, John and Emazon fill a questionnaire about their experience with the platform and give suggestions to it.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Class Diagram}
The UML Class Diagram shown below provides a conceptual, high-level representation of the intended software. At this stage, it may include entities that will not necessarily be part of the final system. Additionally, this diagram intentionally omits methods and other detailed elements that will be addressed in the design phase.
\\The three main components are User, Internship and Student\&Company (which represents the software itself). They are connected with arrows in order to recreate the interactions between one another. The User views the Internship according to his granted permissions. Then he/she interacts with the platform (i.e. accepts a recommendation, submits feedback... ) and eventually the system accordingly manages the Internship.

\subsubsection{State Charts}
The following section outlines the key component (Internship) of the Student\&Company (S\&C) system and its evolution across different phases. To illustrate this, the UML State Chart is presented.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
The diagram in question outlines the potential phases of an Internship. Posted by a Company, the Internship promptly enters the "Application" state, allowing Students to apply and Companies/Students to accept recommendations. 
\\Following the closure of the application window, the system transitions the Internship to the "Selection" state, in which the Candidates are interviewed, selected and confirmed. 
\\In case no Candidate is confirmed, the Internship is archived and transitioned to the "Ended" state. Otherwise, the selected Candidate starts the interning period and the Internship is changed into the "Ongoing" state. 
\\While the Internship is "Ongoing" and the University responsible for the Student receives complaints, it may decide to terminate the Internship. In such cases, the Internship is moved to the "Interrupted" state and archived as is.
\\If the Internship ends without interruptions, before being archived, it waits for both the selected Candidate and the host Company to provide a feedback about the interning experience. The Internship is therefore placed in its "Feedback" state.
\\Only afterwards, the system closes the Internship, transitioning it in the "Ended" state and archiving it.

        \end{itemize}
\subsection{User characteristics}
     A User can be one of three types: Student, University, Company. Each role has access to distinct functionalities and is driven by different motivations.
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Students: They are students of some university; they want to apply for internships, either helped by the recommendations from the platform or by looking for internship themselves. If they have something to say about their on-going internship, they can make observations in the platform.
        \item Companies: They want to recruit students for their internship projects. They are aided in the selection process from the platform. They might want to make observations or complaints about the hired student.
        \item Universities: They want to manage their students' on-going internship, handling their complaints or the ones coming from the company of the internship.     
     \end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
This section serves as a comprehensive overview of critical factors which must be considered during the implementation of the platform. It consolidates the foundational assumptions made during project planning and highlights eventual dependencies.
\subsubsection{Domain Assumptions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item D1 The User must have a working Internet connection.
        \item D2 Students are enrolled in a registered university as students of any kind.
        \item D3 The User registering is either a student, a university or a company.
        \item D4 A university needs to be registered for its students to link their accounts and start applying for internships.

    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
An EmailService is needed, because in the registration process a verifcation email must be sent by the system to let Users successfully sign up.\\ \\The system also wants to have some connection with the universities, so a service for that is needed.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
Due to the non-critical nature of the system, strict performance requirements are not needed. Nonetheless, for the best user experience these are the set requirements:
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
Specifications described in this document must be respected by the system. The source code
of the application must be commented on and documented adequately.
The system should respect the guidelines described by the GDPR.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The system requires any device and a stable internet connection.
\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability}
The system should guarantee an availability equal to 99.5 or more\%. In
other words, the system will be inaccessible for less than two days every year. To achieve this
goal, a high redundancy for the critical components will be ensured.
Furthermore, in order to guarantee better reliability performances, all the scheduled mainte-
nance actions on the system should be done during the night.
\subsubsection{Security}
The connection between the application and the server must be safe. To keep a good level of
security, the system should use the Transport Layer Security protocol. For this purpose, it is
needed an SSL/TSL certificate.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The source code must be commented on as well as possible and the correlated documentation
must be kept updated during the whole life cycle of the system.
Modularity and low coupling between components must be a focus during the designing and
developing phases.
\subsubsection{Portability}

\section{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}
\subsection{Objectives of the Analysis}
This section presents the formal modeling activity conducted using Alloy notation. The primary objective of this work is to provide a rigorous description of the system's domain and its properties.
The main objective of the formal modeling activity is to ensure the correctness, consistency, and efficiency of the platform. By formally modeling key aspects of the system using Alloy, we aim to verify that the system behaves as intended under various conditions and check complex relationships and constraints between entities.

The main aspects that can be proven are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mutual Recommendation and Acceptance
    \item Concurrency Constraints
    \item Internship State Transitions
    \item Correctness of Feedback Submission
    \item Correctness of Comment Submission
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Description of the Model}
The model captures the following key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users and Roles:
    The model distinguishes between three types of users: Student, University, and Company. These users interact with internships in different ways, with students applying to internships, accepting recommendations, and leaving feedback. While, universities manage student data and can interrupt internships.
    \item Internships:
    Internships are the central object in the system, with states that reflect their progression from Application to Ended. Each internship has a status, an applicationDeadline, a startingDate, an endingDate, comments and feedbacks.
    \item Relationships and Constraints.
    Several constraints govern the interactions between users and internships.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Relevance}
Modeling the platform in this way is important for two main reasons. Consistency and scalability.

Consistency is ensured by verifying constraints on internship transitions and user interactions. This guarantees that the platform behaves predictably, reducing the risk of system malfunctions and avoids conflicting actions.

On the other hand, facilitating scalability is equally important. The model ensures that the system remains robust even in scenarios with multiple internships and users interactions. In this way, we can avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure that the platform can scale efficiently without introducing errors.
